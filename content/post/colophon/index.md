This site utilizes a host of opensource tools to deliver fast & efficient content without any ads. Apart from my time, it costs $5 to run.

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for statically generating HTML files
- [Academic](https://academic-demo.netifly.com) theme, with a slight variation
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as my main editor
- [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/) as the primary VPS provider

Static generators dramatically increase the performance of your website, minimizes the need for running risky JavaScript, and provides simplicity with very little dependencies.

If you'd like your own site, explore the resources above starting with Hugo.
