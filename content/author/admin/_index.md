Welcome to my personal website. Here, I showcase a selection of my favorite photographs (not the best per se), and post (or refer you to postings) about software tools, worksflows, and tutorials. This includes a wide variety of topics - from information security and data science, to photography, and other interests.

This site is more for me, but I hope others will find it useful.

If youâ€™re interested in daily postings, checkout my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/celerrime).
